# Rebecca L. Martinez – Curriculum Vitae

Welcome to my CV repository! This project contains the LaTeX source code and compiled PDF of my curriculum vitae. It's built on a modified version of Jason Blevins' minimalist LaTeX CV template and reflects my work in environmental studies, field research, education, and mentorship.

## About Me

I’m an undergraduate researcher and Environmental Studies major at UC Santa Barbara, with a focus on nutrient cycling, ecological monitoring, and data science. My academic journey includes fieldwork, undergraduate mentorship, and science communication.
